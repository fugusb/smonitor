smonitor
========

A python daemon for monitoring devices connected to a switch and sending results to a zabbix server.

The daemon gets a list of MAC addresses of devices on each port of a switch over the SNMP protocol. If it's possible the daemon will scan available local networks with the arp-scan utility to enrich the MAC cache of the switch and to create a mapping derived MAC addresses to IPs. Moreover it tries to map known IP addresses to fully qualified doamin names (FQDN). Lastly all gathered data are processed and sent to a zabbix server.

The smonitor sends log messages to syslog sevice using the facility daemon.

Requirements:
 - Python modules: daemon, syslog
 - Shell commands: ifconfig, snmpwalk, arp-scan, zabbix_sender
 - Rights: it's enough common user rights for daemon running, but you have to set a suid flag for the arp-scan command, because it requires root privileges.
